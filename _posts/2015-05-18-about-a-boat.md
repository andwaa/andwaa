Once upon a time there was a boat, and it sailed the seen seas all day and all night. It didn't have a care in the world. The boat saw bright beautiful days and it saw ominous overcast days, but it kept on sailing anyways. 

Until one day it came across the greyest patch of clouds it ever saw. Before the boat knew it, the wind blew him straight into a thunderstorm! Thunder crashed right above his head, and lightning zapped him.
